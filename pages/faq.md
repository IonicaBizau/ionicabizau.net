## What operating system are you using?
Synce the end of 2012, I use Linux distributions. In present, I'm using Ubuntu
14.04 with Unity desktop that fits perfeclty with my needs.

[ElementaryOS][1] is another Linux distribution (Ubuntu based) that I like and
used in the past.

## Your favorite text editor?
I spend a lot of time in terminal, and that's why I like [VIM][2].

If you're on Ubuntu (or one of its derivates), just do a `sudo apt-get install vim`
and you have it.
