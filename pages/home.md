Hi. My name is Ionică Bizău. I am an 18 (still counting!) year old student, web
developer and piano player from Romania.

I have started studying computer science since 2010, starting with little C++
algorithms and continuing with Microsoft technologies (C#, WPF, Windows Forms).
2012 was the year when I switched from Windows to Linux, entering the open
source world. Loving C#, I wanted a close alternative. That's why I tried Java,
but I didn't like it! Later, I will discover really better programming
languages.

In the end of 2012, I became a member of the [jillix team][1], a Swiss company,
working as web developer. That's how I met Node.JS.

In my free time I like to write plugins and modules (most of them written in
JavaScript/Node.JS), publishing them on [GitHub][2]. There I maintain more than
100 open source projects. I love JavaScript a lot. It's easy and powerful...
just perfect for me. Also, sometimes I write small bash scripts that optimize my
work.

I am a [StackOverflow user][3], being on 22nd position from top 200 users from
Romania. You can checkout [my profile][4].

You can find my music videos on [my YouTube channel][5].

If you want to contact me, just [write me a message](/contact) and I reply you
shortly.
