Hi. My name is Ionică Bizău. I am an 18 (still counting!) year old student, web
developer and piano player from Romania.

I started studying computer science five years ago, starting with little C++
algorithms and continuing with Microsoft technologies (C#, WPF, Windows Forms).
2012 was the year when I switched from Windows to Linux, entering the open
source world. Loving C#, I wanted a close alternative. That's why I tried Java,
but I didn't like it... Later, I will discover programming languages that I will
really like!

In the end of 2012, I became a member of the [jillix team][1], a Swiss company,
working as web developer. That's how I met Node.JS.

~~In my free time,~~ I like to write plugins and modules (most of them written in
JavaScript/Node.JS), publishing them on [GitHub][2]. There I have a lot of open
source projects. I love JavaScript a lot. It's easy and powerful... just perfect
for me. Also, sometimes I write small bash scripts designed to optimize my work.

I am a [StackOverflow user][3], being on [21nd position from Romanian users][4].
You can check out [my profile by clicking here][5].

You can find my music videos on [my YouTube channel][6].

If you want to contact me, just [write me a message][7] and I reply you
shortly. If you just want to say *"Hi"*, that's cool too. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
