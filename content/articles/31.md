I was 7 years old when I first found out what the Tangram Square is. I saw it in a Maths book and I quickly started to have fun with it.:dizzy:

The [Tangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangram) is a Chinese geometrical puzzle consisting of a square cut into seven pieces:

 - 2 large right triangles
 - 1 medium right triangle
 - 2 small right triangles
 - 1 square
 - 1 parallelogram

These pieces can be used to create different shapes (animals, objects etc).

Recently I thought that it's not a bad idea to to bring this game on the WEB, so anybody can play it.

### And I did it! You can play it [here](https://ionicabizau.github.io/tangram/). :sparkles:

Using [`svg.js`](http://svgjs.com/) and a bit of math I created the pieces. To make them interactive, I set up the mouse-related events (click, drag etc):

 - **Left click**: rotate left
 - **Right click**: rotate right
 - **CTRL + left click**: flip
 - **Hold left click + move**: drag

You can build pretty much anything. From hearts... :sparkling_heart:

...and a lot of [other shapes](https://www.google.ro/search?q=tangram+ideas&tbm=isch). Then, once you got it, be creative and create your own stuff.
