It's time to bring the flat colors into your terminal! I've released a theme for Gnome Terminal that is [published on GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme).

To install it, simply do:

```sh
$ npm install terminal-flat-theme
```

or clone the repository and import the theme manually:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme.git terminal-flat-theme
$ cd terminal-flat-theme
$ gconftool-2 --load terminal-flat-theme.xml
```

The colors are stored in the `terminal-flat-theme.xml` file that was generated with `gconftool-2`.

Also, [any improvements are welcome](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme#how-to-contribute)!
