To continue the idea of peace and meditation, this second section of Op. 148 is yet another piece to inspire the souls of the listeners and to create calmness.

The apostle Paul once wrote to the Philippians with his concern on this topic:

“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” — Philippians 4:6, 7 (NIV)

I chose a soft registration so that the listeners’ minds can meditate in the sacred atmosphere of the church and get closer to God.

I am very thankful to Fr. Szabó Ervin for letting us record this.
