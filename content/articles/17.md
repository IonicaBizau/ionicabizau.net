I'm happy to announce **IsRespo 1.0.0** the newest release of *IsRespo* – a tool for visualizing how websites are loaded on different devices (big displays, laptops, tables, phones etc).

![](/images/posts/14/1.png)

The tool is [available online][2], but it can be downloaded via `git` or `npm`, also:

```sh
# git
$ git clone git@github.com:IonicaBizau/IsRespo.git

# npm
$ npm install isrespo
```

In this new version I added Firefox compatibility and a friendly error page when the page cannot be loaded in the `<iframe>` element. This is a limitation because the pages that have the `X-Frame-Options: deny` response header cannot be embedded in `<iframe>` elements.

For checking the `X-Frame-Options` header value I used a service created by [Ivan Žužak (@izuzak)][3]: [*urlreq*][4]. We can get the headers making the HTTP request in the debug mode: `http://urlreq.appspot.com/req?method=GET&url=<url>&debugMode=1` (notice the `debugMode=1` paramter).
