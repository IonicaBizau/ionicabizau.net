In 2017 I travelled to India for 5 weeks. Finally, I took the time to write about what I learned there. As European, I tried my best to adapt to the Indian life as much as possible, eating what and how they eat. I was lucky because [Bhargav](https://twitter.com/imbhargav5)–an Indian friend travelled with me and I had the privilege to be hosted for a few days at [Suresh](https://twitter.com/SureshAtta).

I made this video which covers a couple of highlights from India:

Summarizing, here are some things I learned during these 5 weeks:

 1. **The Chaotic Trafic** 

    They honk a lot! And I mean... a lot! It is fun! It reminded me about the Romanian weddings when they use they honk while driving to the restaurant. Cars, bikes, bicycles, people, animals, all on the narrow streets. Kinda. But in any case, if you want to cross the street, look on the right side, on the left side, forward, backwards, upwards, downwards and only then cross the street and show to the drivers that you are crossing the street, so they will stop and honk... they will honk anyways.

 2. **English is official language**

    Hindi and English are official languages, so if you talk English everybody will understand you... well, not everybody, but I didn't have problems with communication. English with the Indian accent is so cute too. 

 3. **Indian food**

    It's spicy. Really spicy. It makes you cry. But it is so tasty! I loved it. As a vegetarian, I was impressed by [these marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian_and_non-vegetarian_marks): a green square + circle means the food is vegetarian. If it is red, it is *not* vegetarian.

   Oh, and ate with my right hand! It's fun!

 4. **Indians are very friendly!**
 
    I was amazed by their hospitality. I visited a couple of families, two churches and was hosted for a few days at an Indian friend. They did the best for me to feel good in their homes! Food was way better than in the restaurants.

    Also, they ask a lot of questions! How much costed your iPhone? How much costed you to reach their country? Where are you from? And stuff like that. Do not forget to ask them whatever you want. They will be happy to answer!

    They will take photos with you! On the street, at the touristic points etc. Just be patient and you will see so many happy faces!

    Indians will stare at you if you are not an Indian. I remember walking along the street and everywhere I was looking, I was seeing lovely eyes staring at me. I was smiling... and getting smiles back!

 5. **Don't take stuff for granted**

    **Water?** Always drink it from the sealed bottles. They are cheap. Make sure they do not have fake logos and double-check if they are sealed. I did the mistake to drink "DRINKABLE WATER" from a railway station and it was bad. Really bad. I got sick for a couple of days, but now it is a fun memory to share with my friend.

    **Toilet paper?** At some hotels, you will find toilet paper. Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dKkryfdtMNQ) to learn how to use the Indian toilet. It's easy. :joy: :see_no_evil:

    **Internet?** At hotels, the internet tends to be very slow... but good enough for messaging. If you need faster internet, you may need to buy a SIM card and use a portable router.

    **ATMs don't really work** Some of them have no physical money, others were blocked by my bank, others were simply not working and I did find a couple which worked.

If you want to visit India, perhaps you need to talk to your epidemiologist to take the needed vaccines and medication, apply for a visa online, buy the tickets and fly!

My experience in India was intense and I definitely want to go again!
