Bible is full of beautiful verses that encourage us and light our path in this world. While they *all* are important, I have some favorite passages that I like in special. Here are seven of them. :dizzy:

### John 3.16
> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

Thanks to Jesus, we have the chance *to have eternal life* and be forever with our heavenly Father. 

### John 14:6

> Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”

According to this verse, the only way to get the salvation from sin is Jesus–the truth and the life. There is no other way.

### 2 Peter 3:9-13
> The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.

> But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The heavens will disappear with a roar; the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done in it will be laid bare.

> Since everything will be destroyed in this way, what kind of people ought you to be? You ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of God and speed its coming. That day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire, and the elements will melt in the heat.

> But in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth, where righteousness dwells.

This world we know is *not* our home. Believing God's promise, we're waiting a new heaven and a new earth where *shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying* (Revelation 21:4).

### Genesis 2:29

> Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food.

This is one of the reasons why I am vegetarian. :green_apple: Humans were not designed to eat meat, but vegetables. And by the way, on the new earth nobody will eat meat (even the animals will not eat each others, see Isaiah 65:25). :leaves: :grapes:

### Revelation 22:12

 > “Look, I am coming soon! My reward is with me, and I will give to each person according to what they have done. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.

Jesus is coming soon, yes, He's coming! :sparkles:

### Malachi 4:1-3

> Surely the day is coming; it will burn like a furnace. All the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble, and the day that is coming will set them on fire,” says the Lord Almighty. “Not a root or a branch will be left to them. 

> But for you who revere my name, the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its rays. And you will go out and frolic like well-fed calves.

> Then you will trample on the wicked; they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when I act,” says the Lord Almighty.

There will come a day, a day of victory, when the sin will disappear and all the things will be new. :high_brightness:

### Psalm 119:105

> Your word is a lamp to my feet<br>
> And a light to my path.

May God help us to say the same and His word be a light in the darkness of this world! :flashlight:
