I've released a new version of the [`image-to-ascii`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii) NodeJS package which is used for converting images into ASCII art.

It's super easy to use. Let's take a look.

## Prerequisites
You have to install [GraphicsMagick](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/) before using this package:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install graphicsmagick # Ubuntu
$ brew install graphicsmagick         # Mac OS X
```

## Usage

After the prerequisites are installed, you can install the module: `npm install image-to-ascii`. Then you can start ASCIIfying images.

Let's use [this Octocat](https://octodex.github.com/saint-nicktocat/) in our tests. The url of the image is [`https://octodex.github.com/images/saint-nicktocat.jpg`](https://octodex.github.com/images/saint-nicktocat.jpg).

So, to convert this image into ASCII art, you'll have to do:

```js
require("image-to-ascii")("https://octodex.github.com/images/saint-nicktocat.jpg", function (err, result) {
    console.log(result);
})
```

The result is:

![Saint Nicktocat](/images/posts/16/1.png)

This is the default behavior. We can modify it using [an object instead of a string](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii#params).

Don't forget to [browse the code and documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/image-to-ascii)... and ASCIIfy the world! <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i>
