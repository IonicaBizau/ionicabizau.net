Jesus said: 

“Peace I leave with you; my peace I give you. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid.” — John 14:27 (NIV)

Sometimes we need to stop from the usual daily activities to take a few moments to meditate, to find the peace that Jesus gives us.

That is what this song is about. I played it choosing a soft registration of Principal 8’ and Flute 8’ with the hope to bring peace to each one that listens to it. 

Being connected to Him we will find peace.
