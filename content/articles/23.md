I created a tiny tool for visualizing the programming languages collected from someone's GitHub repositories. It is [available here, being hosted on GitHub pages](http://ionicabizau.github.io/github-profile-languages/).

Below, you can see an embeded chart with my programming languages: 

<iframe width='600' height='600' src='https://ionicabizau.github.io/github-profile-languages/api.html?IonicaBizau' frameborder='0'></iframe>

We get the data via the GitHub API and then render the language stats using [drawPieChart](https://github.com/githiro/drawPieChart).

It also has an API for embeding (you already saw I embeded it in this article). You can embed it via an `<iframe>` element which looks like this (replace `username` with your username):

```html
<iframe width='600' height='600' src='https://ionicabizau.github.io/github-profile-languages/api.html?username' frameborder='0'></iframe>
```

I used the colors that GitHub uses for programming languages. I [exported them in JSON format](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/github-colors), from the [linguist](https://github.com/github/linguist/) repository.
