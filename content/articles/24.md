Sometimes I have ideas about interesting tools to develop but I don't have time to build them. Since I use Node.JS and [NPM (Node Package Manager)](https://www.npmjs.com/) I created [`npmreserve`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/npmreserve) â€“ a tool for reserving package names on NPM. :bulb:

## Installation

Supposing NodeJS and NPM are already installed on your machine, `npmreserve` can be installed running:

```sh
$ npm i -g npmreserve
```

### Usage
The command line tool usage is simple. Let's say you want to *reserve* the `foo` package. For that you need to run:

```sh
$ npmreserve -n foo
```

This will create a package containing the `README.md` and `package.json` files. While the description is not mandatory, you can provide it:

```sh
$ npmreserve -n foo -d 'some description'
```

Also, you can pass other [`package.json` fields](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json):

```sh
$ npmreserve -n foo -d 'some description' -o '{"author": "Alice"}'
```

In short, this is how to use `npmreserve`. For detailed information run `npmreserve -h`.

This can be used as library as well. Check out the [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/npmreserve) and as always I accept contributions!  <img src="http://i.imgur.com/Zo9qc6v.png" alt="" height="20" align="absmiddle" class="no-lightbox emoji">

So, happy NPM package reserving!
