I write a lot of code every day, publishing my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau) and [*npm*](https://npmjs.com/~ionicabizau). Each tiny package I create does something, and in most of the cases it's a module which can be used in other applications. :four_leaf_clover:

## :thought_balloon: What is *npm*?

In case you don't know, [*npm*](https://npmjs.com) is the default package manager for Node.js. Note that there we can publish modules which are not Node.js specific.

Its name stands for * **n**eed **p**ray **m**ore* (or *nuclear pizza machine*, or *npm's pretty magical* etc etc).

> **Whaaat?!**

Well, if you are here and think that *npm* stands for *Node Package Manager*, I have to tell you that's also correct, but it's not complete. *npm* is **not** an acronym, but it's a recursive bacronym for * **npm** is not an acronym*. In short, **npm is an bacronym***, not an acronym like many people believe.

You can refer to [npm/npm-expansions](https://github.com/npm/npm-expansions) for a list of things *npm* stands for. :sparkles:

At this very moment while writing this post, I currently have 561 packages. You can view them [here (`npm/~ionicabizau`)](https://npmjs.com/~ionicabizau).

## :raised_hands: How I do it

I started learning Node.js at the end of the year 2012. I was enjoying using modules by others, but I published my first npm package in August 2013. It was [`youtube-api`](https://npmjs.com/youtube-api)–a friendly Node.js wrapper for the YouTube API. :tv:

I liked the `npm publish`ing workflow and I didn't stop there. I created more and more packages.

## :rocket: How to create an npm package?

Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed, you have to generate a `package.json` file then write your code and publish it:

```sh
# Generate the package.json file
npm init

# Work on your magic
echo 'module.exports = 42' > index.js

# Publish the stuff
npm publish
```

But a good package should include good documentation as well as easy to use APIs and easy examples.

## :crystal_ball: Automatization and magic

From publishing new stuff on npm, I found that I was doing a bit of manual work every time. That included:

 1. Creating GitHub repositories
 2. Creating releases on GitHub
 3. Maintaing documentation in sync with the code
 4. Maintaining the same documentation format across the repositories

I started to analyze where I wasted time and created small tools to do the work for me. :worker:

### :memo: [Blah](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/blah): Fancy Documentation

I created a tool called [`blah`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/blah) which, since 2014, takes care of generating the documentation for me:

 - It generates `README.md` files based on my templates.
 - Handles custom stuff by looking at the `blah` field in `package.json`
 - Generates documentation by looking at the JSDoc comments from my code.
 - Bumps the `package.json` version
 - Creates the `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE` (takes care of updating the year as well!), `.travis.yml` and `.gitignore` files

Pretty cool. Since then I didn't have to manually write Markdown files anymore.

### :page_with_curl: [Packy](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/packy): `package.json` defaults

Every time you `npm init` a package, you have to write stuff like the `author`, git repository, `license` etc.

I created `packy` which takes static (e.g. author) and dynamic (e.g. git repository url) fields by looking at a configuration file.

After this, I was manually writing the `name` and `description` fields and then skipping the others. Then, I ran `packy` which was autocompleting the `author`, `keywords`, git-related stuff and so on.

Since `blah` can run custom commands for me, I decided to integrate `packy` in my `blah` configuration.

### :tophat: [np-init](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/np-init): Automagically create new packages

Because I was still lazy to create the files manually, I created `np-init` which creates a minimal npm module:

```sh
np-init my-super-package-name 'Some fancy description'
```

Then I just have to `cd my-super-package-name` and work on my code directly because everything is there for me (`example/index.js`, `lib/index.js`, `package.json` etc).


### :dizzy: [babel-it](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/babel-it): babelify the things

Because I started to use ES2015 features in my code and since many people use versions of Node.js which do *not* support ES2015, I started publishing transpilled versions of my code on npm.

After building `babel-it`, I replaced the `npm publish` command with **`babel-it`**! That is smart enough to babelify my code, publish it on npm and then rollback to my original code.

### :ship: [Ship Release](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/ship-release)

The publishing process was boring again. I decided to create a tool to take care of that: [`ship-release`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/ship-release).

So that being said, I don't even need to take care of babelifying the things because `ship-release` does that (using `babel-it`).

After fixing a bug into a package, I simply do:

```sh
# Creates and switches on the new-version branch
ship-release branch -m 'Fixed some nasty bug'

# Bump the version
ship-release bump

# Publish
#  - generate docs using Blah
#  - push the changes on GitHub
#  - create and merge the pull request
#  - create a new release in the GitHub repository
#  - transpile the code
#  - publish the new version on npm
ship-release publish -d 'Fixed some nasty bug.'
```

----

That's the theory. Let's see all these running in the real world.

## Example

Today I'm creating a small module called `stream-data` which will collect the data emitted by a stream and send it into a callback.

### Creating the package

As mentioned above, I'm using `np-init` to do that:

```sh
np-init stream-data 'Collect the stream data and send it into a callback function.'
```

This created the following directory:

```sh
stream-data/
├── (.git)
├── example
│   └── index.js
├── lib
│   └── index.js
└── package.json

2 directories, 3 files
```

### Write a minimal example

When building a house, you have to start with the base. When building an npm package, I like to start with the roof.

Even if the library doesn't do anything yet, I just set up an example the way I'm thinking I want the module to work.

So, I `cd stream-data` and write this (note that I already had something there created by `np-init`):

```js
"use strict";

const streamData = require("../lib")
    , fs = require("fs")
    ;

// Create a read stream
let str = fs.createReadStream(`${__dirname}/input.txt`);

// Pass the stream object and a callback function
streamData(str, (err, data) => {
    console.log(err || data);
    // => "Hello World"
});
```

### Write the functionality in the library

`np-init` generated a JSDoc comment, which initially looked like this:

```js
/**
 * streamData
 * Collect the stream data and send it into a callback function.
 *
 * @name streamData
 * @function
 * @param {Number} a Param descrpition.
 * @param {Number} b Param descrpition.
 * @return {Number} Return description.
 */
```

I slightly changed the function parameters' names and updated the JSDoc comment:

```js
"use strict";

/**
 * streamData
 * Collect the stream data and send it into a callback function.
 *
 * @name streamData
 * @function
 * @param {Stream} str The stream object.
 * @param {Function} cb The callback function.
 * @returns {Stream} The stream object.
 */
module.exports = function streamData (str, cb) {

    if (cb) {
        let buffer = []
          , error = null
          ;

        str.on("data", chunk => buffer.push(chunk));
        str.on("error", err => error = err);
        str.on("end", () => cb(error, buffer.join(""), buffer));
    }

    return str;
};
```

### Run the example

Well, now we can see if it's really working.

```sh
$ node example/
Hello World!
```

Before publishing it, we need to set up some tests.


### Tests

For testing I use [`tester`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/tester). To add `tester` in my project I do [`tester-init`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/tester-init).

```sh
$ tester-init
...
$ tree
...
└── test
    └── index.js
```

After writing a few tests, the module is ready to be published on GitHub and npm.

### Publishing

We have to create a GitHub repository. I use [`ghrepo`](https://mattdesl/ghrepo) by [**@mattdesl**] (thanks! :cake: :grin:). It's smart enough to create the GitHub repository with the right data (taken from the local git repository url and `package.json`).

```sh
ghrepo --bare --no-open
ship-release bump
ship-release publish -d 'Initial release'
```

Looking in my directory now, I have a couple of new files (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore` etc).

Now my module is on GitHub and npm ready to be `npm install`ed:

```js
// After doing: `npm install --save stream-data`

const streamData = require("stream-data")
    , fs = require("fs")
    ;

// Create a read stream
let str = fs.createReadStream(`${__dirname}/input.txt`);

// Pass the stream object and a callback function
streamData(str, (err, data) => {
    console.log(err || data);
});
```

Do not do manual work. Optimize things as much as you can. Otherwise, you'll waste your precious time. Create your team of bots to help you to optimize things.

Happy *npm*ing! :tada:
