During the last couple of weeks, we had been working on some recordings featuring sacred music for pipe organ written by Bach and Louis J.-A. Lef√©bure-W√©ly.

I am happy to share with you this good news that the videos are finally ready and posted on this page soon.

The filming sessions were taken place in two churches in Oradea, Romania - Rogerius Reformed Church and The Descent of the Holy Spirit Church.

Thanks to @Stefan Jacob, @Dorian Corb and @Cristian Stoican for recording and editing.

Here I'd like to give my organ teacher Prof. Zsolt Garai a special thanks, for guiding me throughout this journey with his kindness and patience.

Soli Deo Gloria! üôè
