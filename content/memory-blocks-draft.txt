Playing computer games is lot of fun. Playing games that improve brain function is even better. The first computer game I ever played was one of these.

It happened when visited a friend when I was 6 year old in the neighboring village. That time there were not so many computers like there are today. My friend asked me to play a computer game he thought I would enjoy. I did that and it was my favorite computer game at the time (back in 2001).

The game I played was **Memory Blocks**, which is part of the *Symantec Game Pack* created by Charles Timmerman‚Äìfounder of [Funster](http://funster.com) and author of over 90 puzzle books.

Since then I did lot of things. One of them is that I became a web developer. So, I thought: it should be interesting to bring this game back to life and everyone be able to play it in their browsers. Lot of people love oldies. Not long time ago I created a COBOL bridge for Node.js and [the feedback was amazing](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-cobol#press-highlights).

And I did it! You can play it [clicking here](https://ionicabizau.github.io/memory-blocks/):

Below is how I did it:

### Step 1: Modularize all the things!

Instead of having a monolithic project doing one thing I preferred to separate the core part into a separate library. That's how [`match.js`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/match.js) appeared. Using `match.js` everybody can develop a similar memory blocks games. [OctiMatch](http://ionicabizau.github.io/OctiMatch/) is a good example: it has the same rules, but it uses the [GitHub Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/) in the blocks.

### Step 2: *Steal* the images from the original game

I set up Windows in a virtual machine and took screenshots and cropped the images that should be displayed in the yellow blocks. There are [30 distinct images](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/memory-blocks/tree/gh-pages/images).

### Step 3: Use `match.js` to build the actual game 

I used the library I created to build this game: basically passing the paths to the images and some options. This was probably the simplest part. I got an initial working version. The next step was to make it look exactly like in the original game.

### Step 4: CSS Magic

I worked together with [**@tonkec**](https://github.com/tonkec) on this. She made the amazing 3D block spinning animations. It was tricky to do that but we did it. Btw, she has some nice [CodePens](http://codepen.io/tonkec/). :sparkles: 

### Step 5: High Scores and other features

I implemented the high scores. The data is kept in the browser local storage and is rendered in retro tables, like in the original game. :joy:

Also I implemented the retro windows (e.g. *About & How to play*), made it possible to switch between the grayscale and colored modes and to choose the difficulty (little or big board).

### Step 6: Do it right!

Before making the game public, I did a quick search to see who is the original game author and where can I find him. After a quick investigation I found Charles Timmerman‚Äìthe founder of [funster.com](http://funster.com/)‚Äìand I was about 90% sure this is the guy I want to talk to.

I kindly emailed him and asked to allow me using his images in my clone. I was wondering if he would reply me.

After two days he sent me an enthusiastic reply. *Amazing! That looks exactly my game!* he said.

> I like how the high score table looks the same and even the black & white option is preserved. In those days, there were Windows computers that were in black & white! You might be interested to know that I wrote all the games in assembly language- my choice in those days over the usual C.

And he also agreed to use the designs and images in my game clone.

### Step 7: Open-source all the things
I [open-sourced the repository](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/memory-blocks) on GitHub and tweeted about it:

### Feedback

One of the things I like to do is to [teach people to code](/training). I usually share with my mentees the news I have (e.g. projects I build, something interesting I do etc).

It was a nice surprise that one of my mentees sent me three books with Bible puzzles by the author.

Also Timmerman sent me two signed
