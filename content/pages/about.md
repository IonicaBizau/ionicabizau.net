Hi. My name is Ionică Bizău. I am a 21 (still counting!) year old student, web
developer, and piano player from Romania.

I started studying computer science five years ago, starting with little C++
algorithms and continuing with Microsoft technologies (C#, WPF, Windows Forms).
2012 was the year when I switched from Windows to Linux, entering the open
source world. Loving C#, I wanted a close alternative. That's why I tried Java,
but I didn't like it... Later, I would discover programming languages that I
really liked!

In the end of 2012, I became a member of the [jillix team][1], a Swiss company,
working as web developer. That's how I discovered Node.JS.

~~In my free time,~~ I like to write plugins and modules (most of them written in
JavaScript/Node.JS), publishing them on [GitHub][2]. There, I have a lot of open
source projects. I love JavaScript. It's easy and powerful; just perfect for me.
Also, I sometimes write small bash scripts designed to optimize my work.

I am a [StackOverflow user][3], being in [10th position amongst Romanian users][4].

You can find my music videos on [my YouTube channel][5].

If you want to contact me, just [write me a message][6] and I will reply quickly.
If you just want to say *"Hi"*, that's cool too. :smile:
