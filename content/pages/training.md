Hey there! :grin:

We use software every day. Software that is developed by people. Using it is something everyone knows to do, reading its code is maybe a more challenging (I would say: the most challenging) task, but writing code that can help other people is definitely a thing. :sparkle:

### :microscope: Expertise

I started coding 5 years ago. I do the best in web development.
If you want to **learn one of these**, or you just **have a bug that you cannot solve**, I'm here to help you:

 - JavaScript
 - Node.js (well, basically it's JavaScript on the server side)
 - Git & GitHub
 - HTML & CSS
 - MongoDB
 - [...and others](https://www.codementor.io/johnnyb)

### :fire: How does it work? :fire:

You can reach me on [Codementor](https://www.codementor.io/johnnyb) and schedule 1:1 sessions with me.
I prefer answering specific questions, rather than having weekly sessions (that may be possible too).

### :moneybag: Pricing

Currently, I charge **$80 / hour**. :zap:
This may change in the future, depending on various factors.
