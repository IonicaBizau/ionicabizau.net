## What operating system are you using?
I've been using Linux distributions since the end of 2012. At present, I'm using Ubuntu
14.10 with Unity desktop, as it fits perfectly with my needs.

[ElementaryOS][1] is another Linux distribution (Ubuntu-based) that I like and
have used in the past.

## Your favorite text editor?
I spend a lot of time in terminal, and that's why I like [VIM][2].

If you're on Ubuntu (or one of its derivatives), just do a `sudo apt-get install vim`
and you'll have it.

## *That window is gorgeous* – What theme do you use?

As GTK theme I use [Flattiance, a fork of the Ambiance theme](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/Flattiance) (the default Ubuntu theme).

As terminal emulator, I use `gnome-terminal`, themed with [the flat terminal theme](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme).
