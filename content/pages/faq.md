## What operating system are you using?

I've been using Linux distributions since the end of 2012. I use different *nix systems on my various machines:

 - Ubuntu 17.10, Unity desktop on my notebook
 - Ubuntu Server 16.04, openbox on my desktop machine
 - Ubuntu Mate 16.04 on my Raspberry Pi 2, and
 - macOS on my MacBook

[ElementaryOS][1] is another Linux distribution (Ubuntu-based) that I like and
have used in the past.

## Your favorite text editor?
I spend a lot of time in terminal, and that's why I like [VIM][2].

If you're on Ubuntu (or one of its derivatives), just do a `sudo apt-get install vim`
and you'll have it.

## *That window is gorgeous* â€“ What theme do you use?

As GTK theme I use [Flattiance, a fork of the Ambiance theme](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/Flattiance) (the default Ubuntu theme).

As terminal emulator, I use `gnome-terminal`, themed with [the flat terminal theme](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/terminal-flat-theme).
