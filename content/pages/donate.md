I love contributing to open-source software and sharing my work with others. If you’ve enjoyed something I've built or written or if you got profit from something I did, and you'd like to support the my projects' development or if you just want to buy me a ~~coffee~~ tea, there are quite a few ways you can do that:


 - [![Buy me a book][badge_amazon]][amazon]—Buy me a physical book. :books:
 - [![PayPal][badge_paypal]][paypal-donations]—You can make one-time donations via PayPal.
 - [![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]—Set up a recurring monthly donation and you will get interesting news about what I'm doing (things that I don't share with everyone). :rocket: You can cancel it anytime.
 - **Bitcoin**—You can send me bitcoins at this address (or scanning the code below): `1P9BRsmazNQcuyTxEqveUsnf5CERdq35V6`
