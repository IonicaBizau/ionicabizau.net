Welcome to my first post on this blog. Bored of complicated designs and settings, I decided to start my own NodeJS based blogging platform.

The theme files are written in HTML, CSS & JSON. The content - including pages and blog posts - is written in Markdown.

> Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that it can optionally be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name.
Markdown is popularly used as format for readme files, or for writing messages in online discussion forums, or in text editors for
the quick creation of rich text documents. <sup>[*Wikipedia*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)</sup>

Because I love JSON format, I decided to save the content details in JSON files. Some server caching methods
are used to give the needed speed and power to this little platform.

All the history is saved in a [git repository](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/ionicabizau.net) that can be forked anybody being able to contribute (fixing typos, grammar etc).

Feel free to [contact](/contact) me. I try to answer every message.
I invite you to follow me on [Twitter @IonicaBizau](https://twitter.com/IonicaBizau) where I anounce my latest projects. Also,
don't forget to check out my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/IonicaBizau).
