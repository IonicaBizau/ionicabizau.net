Two weeks ago I was in Switzerland, together with my colleagues from [jillix][1] team. It was the first time when I traveled to another country and the first time when I traveled by plane. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i> We had a great time together!

One of the services I use everyday is [GitHub][2]. GitHub is the best place for me (and probably for you, too) where I can store the code of my projects in [Git](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) repositories.

[Ivan Zuzak (@izuzak)][4] is one of the guys that work for GitHub. He [works on technical support][5] â€“ helping people to understand Git and GitHub. He helped me to fetch some data that I needed using [GitHub API][6]. I searched him on GitHub and noticed that he lives in Zurich and I said: *I have to meet this awesome guy!*.

And we did it! We (me and my colleagues) had the opportunity to meet him and to talk a little about GitHub.

...and to take a photo together!

He gifted us with a lot of octocat stikers... because every GitHub user loves [octocats][7]. Everybody was so happy!

Talking about octocats, I [hacked][8] my GitHub [contributions calendar][9] displaying **I <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> OCTOCATS <i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i>** message on [my GitHub profile][10]:

Also, I created a [big octocat from octocats in the README file][11].

It was a great week!
