I've just released an image lightbox library that has a very simple API. Its
name is **MiniLightbox**. It's minimalistic and doesn't depend on any library
(e.g. jQuery). It only uses JavaScript, but combined with the power of CSS3
transitions, it's everything I expect from a minimalistic lightbox.

![Demo](/images/posts/8/1.gif)

The project is [open source on GitHub][1]. Anybody able to fork and improve it
is encouraged to do so.

## How to use?
The basic usage is the following: having an `img` element, you just need to pass
a selector string to `MiniLightbox`, after including it on the page.

```html
<img id="myImage" src="myImage.png" alt="Some title">
<script>
    MiniLightbox("#myImage");
</script>
```

If you want to add some nice animations, [animate.css][2] is a good choice.
Adding `customClose` and `customOpen` methods to `MiniLightbox`, we handle popup
opening and closing. By returning `false`, the default behavior will be
prevented (needed when using animations).

```js
MiniLightbox.customClose = function () {
    var self = this;
    self.img.classList.add("animated", "fadeOutDown");
    setTimeout(function () {
        self.box.classList.add("animated", "fadeOut");
        setTimeout(function () {
            self.box.classList.remove("animated", "fadeOut");
            self.img.classList.remove("animated", "fadeOutDown");
            self.box.style.display = "none";
        }, 500);
    }, 500);
    // prevent default library behavior
    return false;
};

MiniLightbox.customOpen = function () {
    this.box.classList.add("animated", "fadeIn");
    this.img.classList.add("animated", "fadeInUp");
};
```

If we only need to display just a small thumbnail and when clicking it to show
the big image, we use the `data-image-opened` attribute, whose value is the path
to the big image:

```html
<img id="myImage" data-image-opened="./big.png" src="small.png" alt="Some title">
```

For documentation, check out the [README file][3] of the project. Any
questions/issues/bugs/features [should be posted here][4].

----

From today, I will use MiniLightbox for this blog. It's just a
[little plugin][5], which, once installed in a Bloggify website, causes the images from
posts and pages to be opened in a fancy lightbox.
