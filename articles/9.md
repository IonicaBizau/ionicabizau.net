Two weeks ago I was in Switzerland, together with my colleagues from
[jillix][1]. It was the first time I'd traveled by plane. We had a great time
together!

I also had the opportunity to meet [Ivan Žužak (@izuzak)][2], who works at in
[technical support][3] at [Github][4]. He helped me with using the
[GitHub API][5]. After I looked him up on GitHub, I noticed that he lives in
Zurich and I thought: *"I have to meet this guy!"*.

And we did! My colleagues from jillix and I had the opportunity to meet him
and talk a little about Github.

He gave us a lot of Octocat stickers! We were super happy, cause everybody loves
[Octocats][6]!

Talking about Octocats, I [hacked my GitHub contributions calendar][7] displaying an
"**I <i class="fa fa-heart"></i> OCTOCATS! <i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i>**"
message on my [GitHub profile][8]:

[The repository][9] also contains a fancy README file, which shows [a big
Octocat made out of Octocats!][10]

It was a great week!
