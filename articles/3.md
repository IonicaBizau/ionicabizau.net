I am happy to announce the name of this blogging platform: **Bloggify**. It's just simple to pronounce and it's related to the term of *blogging*.

[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) gives an interesting definition of [this term](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=bloggify):

> to "bump" or "upgrade" a messageboard user's post or comment to a front page blog entry based on quality or content. initially used by the messageboard at talk.johnsebben.com

> related words include: bloggified, bloggification

> *"My post was good enough for a bloggification! Why wasn't it you jackasses. Bloggify it!"*
