Many people use RSS readers to get updated from the sites subscribed.

I built a [Bloggify plugin][1] that adds this feature to my blog which runs [Bloggify][2].

The RSS feed page is located at `/api/rss`, so you can add the `http://ionicabizau.net/api/rss` url to your RSS reader sources to get updated when a new article is posted here.

I used the *QuiteRSS* application for testing the things out.
