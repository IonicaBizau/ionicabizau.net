Many people use RSS readers to get updated from the sites subscribed.

I built a [Bloggify plugin](http://bloggify.org/) that adds this feature to my blog which runs Bloggify.

The RSS feed page is located at `/api/rss`, so you can add the `http://ionicabizau.net/api/rss` url to your RSS reader sources to get updated when a new article is posted here.
