Many people use RSS readers to get updates from the sites subscribed.

I built a [Bloggify plugin][1] that brings the RSS feed page on my blog which runs [Bloggify][2].

The RSS feed page is [`http://ionicabizau.net/api/rss`](http://ionicabizau.net/api/rss). So you can add it to your RSS reader sources to be notified when a new article is posted here.

I used the *QuiteRSS* application for testing the things out.
