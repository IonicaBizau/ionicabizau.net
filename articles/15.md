Using GitHub in a browser like Chrome, Firefox etc. is fine, but not always comfortable. When you always stay in a [Terminal window](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator), pressing <kbd>alt</kbd> + <kbd>tab</kbd> becomes annoying. This problem can be solved using a text browser (e.g. [Elinks](http://elinks.or.cz/)). However, using a text browser for browsing GitHub is not the most comfortable way to access GitHub resources.

That's why I created [CLI GitHub: a GitHub fancy client for command line written in NodeJS](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/cli-github).

## Prerequisites
Before installing `cli-github`, you have to ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org) and [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org) are installed. If they are installed already, you can install CLI GitHub.

## Installation and Usage
You can install CLI GitHub by running `npm install -g cli-github` and then `github`.

Local installation is also possible:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:IonicaBizau/cli-github.git
$ cd cli-github
$ npm install
$ ./bin/github
```

When running it first time, the application will need your username and password. Then you will be logged in and *News Feed* will appear:

If you want to visit your profile, press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> and then <kbd>enter</kbd> (default profile you want to open is yours):

![CLI GitHub - Profile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IonicaBizau/cli-github/master/screenshots/profile.png)

To go back to *News Feed*, press <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd>.

## Features
Currently, the supported features are:

 - Create repositories
 - Visit GitHub profiles
 - View the issues assigned to you
 - View the pull requests created by you

In background, authenticated requests to [GitHub API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) are made. Thanks [Ivan Žužak (@izuzak)](https://github.com/izuzak) for awesome support.
