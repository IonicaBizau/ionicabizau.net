Working with NodeJS modules I was doing the following ~~repetitive~~ boring tasks:

 1. Create the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, `.gitignore` files.
 2. Bump `package.json` versions.
 3. Add documentation.

That's why I created [`Blah`](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-blah) â€“ a command line tool written in NodeJS that will speed up these tasks.

I open sourced this application and released the first stable version:

To install it from NPM, just run `sudo npm install -g blah`. For more details how to use *Blah*, check out [the project page on GitHub](https://github.com/IonicaBizau/node-blah).
